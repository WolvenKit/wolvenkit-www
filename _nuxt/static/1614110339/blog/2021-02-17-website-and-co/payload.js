I can answer that: everyone working under the Red Modding Initiative!

We do not fall under any direct, official jurisdiction of CD Projekt Co. Ltd. or their subsidiary CD Projekt Red, but are in the early stages of collaborating with them. None of our members are working full time, it should go without saying, meaning everyone is doing this in their free time.

The Nexus has rules in place that prevent mods from using telemetry networking. With the release of 1.10, basic anonymous telemetry was added to CET. This allowed Yamashi (the creator of CET) to anonymously count the amount of users actively using CET to gauge the use and level of interest in the project. This was done to ensure ongoing development efforts of the tool aren’t done in vain (i.e. why continue developing the tool if no one is using it?)
