We toil day and night to make modding a reality, and currently we're working on big stuff. Most importantly, we've started work on our very own mod manager! More on that later in this post."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"As is known, we are working on reverse engineering REDEngine 4; specifically, to understand the layout of .archive files and being able to make the game to load our own custom ones.
