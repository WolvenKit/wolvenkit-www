Lua scripts can now be loaded during gameplay or upon initialization of the game. Currently, debug versions of the tool are being dropped on GitHub. Advancements are being made in leaps right now, and a lot of new content being added. A big thank you to Yamashi, the original creator of the mod, and WhySoSerious, actively improving on and developing the mod.

There is more to it, so for more info, join our Discord server or take a look at the GitHub repo.

It would be an understatement to say they've been going through a lot of stuff lately, but despite it all, they have come to see that getting the community involved is a good idea. We are thus honored to have heard from CDPR openly encouraging the modding community and expressing interest in adding official mod support. We hadn't heard from them at all up to this point, but that has changed today (01.15.2021), as Traderain, one of the head developers and creator of WolvenKit, informed everyone on the Discord server that he and rfuzzo had gotten in contact with CD Projekt Red and had received the news about them endorsing our work, and that CDPR staff would now be actively helping us. The first step was releasing a nearly complete list of game filenames and hashes, which would have taken us an additional month or more to brute force for ourselves, due in part to how our tool works. We are certain the hashes missing from the list right now are insignificant, being either cut content or copyrighted material that CDPR is obviously not allowed to just hand over like that. This, of course, is not the end of our partnership with CDPR, and that's all there is to say for now."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"As can be seen, the team is working hard on the tools to improve the game in the long term, both in quality and lifetime.

If you have the experience and the interest, come join us on Discord and ask around for the current status, as well as take a look at our multi-purpose GitHub repo. We also welcome those wanting to help in other ways, namely contributing to documentation on the various wikis."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Until then, cheers,\nYour RED Modding Team"}]}]},dir:"\u002Fblog\u002F2021-01-15-cyberpunk-update-no2\u002Flocales",path:"\u002Fblog\u002F2021-01-15-cyberpunk-update-no2\u002Flocales\u002Fen",extension:".md",updatedAt:"2021-04-03T06:11:58.040Z"}}],fetch:{"data-v-34c6b0ef:0":{footer:{slug:"footer",title:"© 2021 Red Modding Tools.
